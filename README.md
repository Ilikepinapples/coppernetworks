This is primarily a power api for my (and other's) mods to be built on top of. It adds a block known as the copper networker that turns any copper blocks that are connected (including all copper variants and things like copper doors) into a network through which power can be transported. Placing another copper networker on the same network turns it into a storage, storages extend the capacity of a network (1000 by default) by 500 each time.


This mod was only recently finished and will likely require future optimisations and language translations outside of English. Contributions on the Github would be greatly appreciated.
